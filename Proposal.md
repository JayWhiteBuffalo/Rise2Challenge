## Problem
There are so many ways to excerise. How can we help form a optimal custom workout plan that caters to the type of exercise I prefer? 
How do I know if the exercise routine I am doing is effective? 
Given limited equipment, what excerises are available for me to perform given a targeted muscle group? 
How can I share my workout routine and recieve feedback from other people on how to improve? 
I want to be able to store : 
A list of exercises and their properties

A list of workouts and their properties (containing exercises)

A list of logged workouts (workout and date of workout)

All the set data from each logged workout (exercise, number of sets, weight of each set, reps of each set)

## Solution

RunBuddy - Rise2Challenge Will allow a User/Member to create their own personal workout plan, share their results, and gain feedback from other users. 







## Project Overview

Workout Plan
The User can create a workout plan that fits all given criteria.
User may specify Month/Week/Day/Duration/Frequency of custom workout routine and save to be accessed later

User may choose from suggested exercises based on
-Intensity:
    High Intensity / Low Intensity
-Class:
    Strength
    Endurance
    Flexibility
-Catagory
    Whole Body
    Upper / Lower
    Target Muscle Group (Abs, Arms, Back, Calves, Chest, Legs etc...)
-Equipment
    Bench Press
    Barbell
    None
    Matt
    Etc.
- Target Muscle Group
    Delts
    Quads
    Tricepts
    Etc..
After Choosing Prefences User will have a list of displayed excercises that they can select and save to their custom workout routine. (e.g Push Day , Pull Day, Leg Day)

After the Routine is made user can then assign Frequency
Ex. Edit by month, week, day
    Push Day - Twice a Week : Monday & Friday
    Pull Day - Twice a Week: Tues & Saturday
    Leg Day - Once every other week: Wensday

User Will have tab(s) for :
